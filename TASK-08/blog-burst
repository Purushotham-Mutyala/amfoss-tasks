Blogging:
        Blogging is the practice of creating and publishing content online to share ideas, insights, or information. It involves choosing a topic, writing engaging and relevant posts,
        and sharing them on a blogging plaatforms.and this blog is gonna be about the task which i think was really helpfull in  gaining many usfull information on ,
        .Platform like Git-hub
        .And got to know much about the linux terminal window which is very usefull and helpfull for open sourse development
        .And importantly learning a lot form my errors
Things i learnt from this task:
                              firstly i was new to the os and the user interface of ubuntu and i sarted to explore it and started to do the task.firstly i am also the one who didnt get anything for
the first time when i went through the things to be followed and to be done.as the mentors of the club mentioned google is the best thing with which u can know the info about which u dont and and its a good 
skill to develop as to be a good developer may be.and i followed the same things and this helped me a lot in gaining the speed through which i was going through the task and the commands given in the
hints of every part were really a life saviour.And somtimes i was stuck in some parts i was unable to use some commands ,but i tried continuing and got to now how to use them too .


conclusion:
           this task was lieke a ride of rollercoaster which was soo exiciting by learning new things which i havent explored till now .this helped me to get beter at using github, the linux command terrminal
and obviosly the kind of phrases used in english which made me struck in the begining of the task.so this was abou the task whih was a bit hard while i stared to do but as i proceded i had got better at
them and have the same enthusiasm to learn new thing on them .And thanks for the  bro who made such a beautifull tak for us guys to upgrade us a lot by doing these tasks.
